							<h2>Hello There, I'm Kit!</h2>

							<p>
								By the fact that you're here I must think that you're looking for me!
							</p>

							<p>
								Currently, I'm working towards a BSC Computer Science degree at the Univerity of Dundee.
								Through this I'm working on a few projects here and there, showcased on this very site. Yes it's a portfolio!
							</p>

							<p>
								I'm still working out exactly what area I want to focus on, but I do have particular interest in Software Engineering & Networking.
							</p>

							<p>
								Please do take a look around at some of my projects! I try to keep as up to date as possible but please reach out for any more information!

							<div class="text-justify">
								<p>
									I've been around computers for so long I can't remember when it started. Sometime around 7 I dived into scratch
									and never looked back.
								</p>
							
								<p>
									From there, I worked on modding scratch games, my dad helped me with a facebook clone with html and angular.js
									and I also was playing with Embedded Systems like Raspberri Pi's with python.
								</p>
							
								<p>
									Time Went on and Scratch Turned into Gamemaker which became Visual Basic, I began working with Vintage PC's to
									understand PC hardware and teh fundementals of software.
									By highschool I was intimately familiar with PC's and electronics, punching up doing work well above my level to
									a high standard.
								</p>
							
								<p>
									Now that I've built up this fundemental foundation in software and hardware, I'm putting it to use in my degree
									learning Java and C/C++,
									working with Pi Pico's in micropython and in my spare time working on electronics repair and building guitar
									pedals and amplifiers.

							<h2 class="text-center">Plans and Ambitions?</h2>
							
							<div class="text-justify">
								<p>
									What do I plan to do you ask? While I may not know particularly where I want to go I do have some goals:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Get fully proficent in C and C++ through the rest of the year</li>
									<li>Complete the Pebl project until it meets the original spec</li>
									<li>Build out this portfolio with some new projects!</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									As for Ideas for where I want to specialise, I have a few areas of interest including:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Networking, Either on the Software or Hardware side I find a lot of developments and how it integrates facinating.</li>
									<li>Software Engineering, This can go a lot of ways from Application Development to Fault-Tolerant Systems.</li>
									<li>Information Security, More specifcally down the route of encryption</li>
									<li>Games Development, More down the route of working on Game Engines with people I know in the Field.</li>
								</ul>
