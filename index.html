							<h2>Hello There, I'm Kit!</h2>

							<p>
								By the fact that you're here I must think that you're looking for me!
							</p>

							<p>
								Currently, I'm working towards a BSC Computer Science degree at the Univerity of Dundee.
								Through this I'm working on a few projects here and there, showcased on this very site. Yes it's a portfolio!
							</p>

							<p>
								I'm still working out exactly what area I want to focus on, but I do have particular interest in Software Engineering & Networking.
							</p>

							<p>
								Please do take a look around at some of my projects! I try to keep as up to date as possible but please reach out for any more information!

											The most expansive project I have worked on, Pebl. It is a basic social media
											client-server pairing similar to
											twitter, but designed with expandibility in mind.
											As a group collaboration we created version 1, since then I have revised the program
											code for
											some minor updates with more being planned with the original team.
											Through this project I was responsible for the JavaFX interface originally, although
											with that
											completed for now I have been working on revising all of the server connection code in
											the
											client and bugfixes.

								<p class="card-text">
									A project I suprisingly really enjoyed working on was this network simulation. The scenario for
									this project was a the
									ABnegation Company was upgrading their network and I was tasked with building a test simulation
									before they committed to
									the expense. This involved the creation of subnets and the use of some complex routing and masks
									to keep the nextworks
									as small as possible while leaving space for expansion, including some complexities from routing
									DHCP packets between
									subnets for the external building without escaping into the wider network and configuration of
									manual IP's and wireless
									Access for other parts of the building. This is the project that has really got me interested in
									Network Engineering.

									This project is a simple, sytrical webpage for an imaginary company called GlorboCorp, selling a

									Set in the distant future of 2055, it takes jabs at the mental state of the fictional developer
									hired to create the site and it's content.
									The real purpose of the site however was to take on learning Bootstrap, The site is entirely
									built with Bootstrap and it's classes over use of css or inline style.

								<h2 class="card-title">Scribble</h2>
								<p class="card-text">
									Scribble started as a Java console based recreation of Scrabble, Originally with a lesser
									ruleset but I eventually expanded this further to the full ruleset,
									Including scoring for overlapping words and special board tiles. A big part of my personal
									additions to the game was well spent on the dynamic board sizing and other touches.
									As much as at it's core it's simple sounding concept, it proved to be a challenge to implement
									and I enjoyed making it and enjoy the finished product.
									I learned a lot about making intuitive command line interfaces for progams from this project
									too. While not as accessible as a GUI, I tried to make it as polished and easy to use as
									possible.
									The final result is I belive a very well polished recreation.

									The first project worked on with the Pebl Team, Shebang is a shell to-do list manager.
									On this project I was initally responsible for the search and sort functions but ended up
									expanding to some
									other methods,
									along with also working on the parameter parcing for the initial script. This taught us all a
									lot about working
									colaborativly through Github, along with general teamwork on a codebase preparing us for the
									larger undertaking that
									Pebl became.

							<div class="text-justify">
								<p>
									I've been around computers for so long I can't remember when it started. Sometime around 7 I dived into scratch
									and never looked back.
								</p>
							
								<p>
									From there, I worked on modding scratch games, my dad helped me with a facebook clone with html and angular.js
									and I also was playing with Embedded Systems like Raspberri Pi's with python.
								</p>
							
								<p>
									Time Went on and Scratch Turned into Gamemaker which became Visual Basic, I began working with Vintage PC's to
									understand PC hardware and teh fundementals of software.
									By highschool I was intimately familiar with PC's and electronics, punching up doing work well above my level to
									a high standard.
								</p>
							
								<p>
									Now that I've built up this fundemental foundation in software and hardware, I'm putting it to use in my degree
									learning Java and C/C++,
									working with Pi Pico's in micropython and in my spare time working on electronics repair and building guitar
									pedals and amplifiers.

								<p>
									What do I plan to do you ask? While I may not know particularly where I want to go I do have some goals:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Get fully proficent in C and C++ through the rest of the year</li>
									<li>Complete the Pebl project until it meets the original spec</li>
									<li>Build out this portfolio with some new projects!</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									As for Ideas for where I want to specialise, I have a few areas of interest including:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Networking, Either on the Software or Hardware side I find a lot of developments and how it integrates facinating.</li>
									<li>Software Engineering, This can go a lot of ways from Application Development to Fault-Tolerant Systems.</li>
									<li>Information Security, More specifcally down the route of encryption</li>
									<li>Games Development, More down the route of working on Game Engines with people I know in the Field.</li>
